This portfolio illustrates a journey from Excel fundamentals to advanced data analysis:

Core Skills: The first project is a deep dive into essential Excel toolsâ€”mastering lookup functions (VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP), logical tests, and data integrity features like data validation and conditional formatting. This ensures clean, accurate, and calculable data.

Advanced Application: The second project applies these skills to a real-world business scenario. The interactive performance dashboard leverages Pivot Tables and Slicers to create a dynamic tool for managers. It automatically visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs), identifies top performers and training opportunities, and drills down into specific error types, showcasing the power of Excel for driving data-informed decisions.
